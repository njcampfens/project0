# Project 0

My project consists of 4 html files: "me", "interests", "cv" and "contact"; along with a css file called "style" generated via sass.

This project is an example of what a CV repository for scientists could look like.

In the index page ("me") we can find a picture and the name and ocupation of the subject in question. If we go to the "interestes" page, we will find a set of themes which the subject has selected of his/her interest. In the page "cv" we will find a list of the scientific publications in which the subject is an author or co-author. And, finally, a contact page with the necessary information to get in touch with this subject. 

We can see that every page has a navigation bar to get to any of the other pages.
